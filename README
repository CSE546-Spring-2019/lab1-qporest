To make the project run `make` inside of the directory.
To run the project run `count <in file> <search string> <out file>`

The algorithm for counting is to keep an array that keeps current "streaks".
It only gets incremented if the current character is the same as the
character in search_string[streak #].
If first letter is the same, new streak is started by making a -1 into a 0.
